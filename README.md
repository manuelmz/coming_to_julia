# coming_to_julia
This is a collection of Pluto notebooks aimed at introducing the Julia language to folks who have experience in "scientific computing" with other languages. 
The focus is on three main aspects:

  - The basics of Julia as a programing langiage
  - How to deal with arrays in Julia
  - An example of the power of the type system in Julia

There is some interest in learning how to use the ITensors.jl package to run DMRG calculations, a notebook explainig the basics will be included. Some other example notebooks might be added in the future.
