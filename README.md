# coming_to_julia
This is a collection of Pluto notebooks aimed at introducing the Julia language to folks who have experience in "scientific computing" with other languages. 
The focus is on two main aspects:

  - The basics of Julia as a programing language
  - How to deal with arrays in Julia

Then some exercises implementing time evolution of elementary cellular automata and quantum cellular autoamata will be explored.

There is some interest in learning how to use the ITensors.jl package to run DMRG calculations, a notebook explainig the basics will be included. Some other example notebooks might be added in the future.
